passing arguments by reference - any problem with that?

Commenting - Is it required/ok to put a comment header in each file with general info.

Input validation and error handling -

Can we assume valid input all around? i.e. not handling multiple whitespace between arguments or getting non-numeric chars where a number is expected.

Is it ok the ignore extra input or should we cancel the command? i.e. "add_item 1 10"

should we print error messages to screen or just ignore them (for compability with automated testing) -
	 if unrecognized command is inputted, what is the required behaviour - ignore/ print error msg / exit
	if "add_after 1 2" but 2 is not in the list - ignore / print/error/exit
